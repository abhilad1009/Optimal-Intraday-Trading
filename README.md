# Optimal-Intraday-Trading
---
Our goal is to find the best time to trade a stock to maximize profit at the end of 2 days.

Following assumptions are set for the solution provided here:


*   This is intraday trading, i.e. we sell all the stocks bought on the same day.
*   There can be only 1 trade in a day, i.e. 1 buy and 1 sell operation.
*   Stocks cannot be bought and sold at the same minute of the day.
*   We buy at low and sell at high price values.

Libraries Used
